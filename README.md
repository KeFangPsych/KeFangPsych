### Hi there! I'm Ke 'Kay' Fang 方可👋

### 🔭 I’m currently a PhD student at Stanford University working with Professor [Robert Hawkins](https://rdhawkins.com/).

### 🤔 I'm interested in computational approaches to understand how distributed individual minds support emergent collective-level behaviors and patterns such as cooperation, social norms, and polarization.

### 📫 You can reach me from [my website](https://kefangpsych.github.io/intro.html). Looking forward to hearing from you! 💬
