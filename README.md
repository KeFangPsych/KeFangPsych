### Hi there! I'm Ke (Kay) Fang👋

### 🔭 I’m currently a Master's student at New York University [Colloective Cognition Lab (CoCoLab)](https://wp.nyu.edu/gallatin-kefang/) working with Professor Madalina Vlasceanu @mvlasceanu.

### 🤔 Questions I ask:

#### - How do people's beliefs and attitudes synchronize and polarize to form social norms in social networks? 

#### - Why do people become (or at least view others as becoming) increasingly polarized and extreme online?  

#### - I try to answer these questions by combining behavioral experiments with macro-level network analysis, agent-based modeling, natural language processing, and micro-level computational cognition to draw a full picture of these complex social dynamics.

### 📫 You can reach me from [my website](https://wp.nyu.edu/gallatin-kefang/). Looking forward to hearing from you! 💬
