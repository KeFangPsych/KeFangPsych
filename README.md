### Hi there! I'm Ke (Kay) Fang👋

### 🔭 I’m currently a Master's student at New York University [Colloective Cognition Lab (CoCoLab)](https://www.mvlasceanu.com/)) working with Professor Madalina Vlasceanu [@mvlasceanu](https://github.com/mvlasceanu).

### 🤔 Questions I ask:

### - How do people's beliefs and attitudes synchronize💑 and polarize🤼 to form social norms in social networks? 


### - Why do people become (or at least view others as becoming) increasingly polarized and extreme online 🎭?  


### - I try to answer these questions by combining behavioral experiments 🧪 with macro-level agent-based modeling, natural language processing, network analysis🕸️ and micro-level computational cognition 🧠 to draw a full picture of these complex social dynamics.


### 📫 You can reach me from [my website](https://wp.nyu.edu/gallatin-kefang/). Looking forward to hearing from you! 💬
